The archive readme permits spreading the original unmodified archive without charging for the game and requires credit to .theprodukkt for public presentation/publication. This record is not permission to repackage stripped files. The scene.org archive includes its archive notice; it is preserved unchanged.

## Compatibility scope and evidence

2026-10-14: fresh pinned download and extraction succeeded on baseline 38ed9da0b plus recovery fix14cc377a7; generated browser companion manifest and executable presence verified. No guest execution or gameplay acceptance yet; no desktop promotion or deployment.

Readme requirements: DirectX9.0b, pixel shaders1.3,512MB RAM. Packed procedural-generation startup may be substantial; no timing measured. Controls: WASD movement,Space jump,left mouse fire,1–5 weapons.

Corpus CLI dry-run currently fails before selection on an unrelated existing Baldur's Gate interactive-demo source assertion (test expects bg-demo/BG Demo.iso, manifest uses Silver Edition ZIP). Neither entry changed here. Resolve separately before using that broad harness.
