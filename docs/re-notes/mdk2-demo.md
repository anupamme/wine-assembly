# MDK2 demo (BioWare/Interplay, 2000)

**Status: not registered — blocked on projective vertices (`glVertex4fv` with
w ≠ 1).** The registration (candidate `mdk2-demo`, app `mdk2_demo`) is kept as
`scratch/wip/mdk2-demo-registration-w5.patch` until that is supported.

## Source

archive.org `Mdk2Demo`: `MDK2Demo.exe`, 86,442,069 bytes, SHA-1
`981cd1f0774c6dae690cdf97bf08d975a43f8e81`. No licence or redistribution
grant (readmeEN.txt names BioWare Corp. and Interplay registration only), so
local-only.

It is an InstallShield 6 self-extractor: 7z unpacks `data1.cab`/`data2.cab`;
**unshield** reads them (`tools/is5-extract.js` refuses: cab version
0x100600c). The game is file group `Minimum` (MDK2.exe launcher,
mdk2Main.exe, `data\base.zip`/`scripts.zip`/`sounds.zip`, Music\*.acm) plus
group `english` (`data\local.zip`, the string tables). Installed to
`c:\mdk2demo`.

## Startup

- **`MDK2.exe` is only the hardware launcher** (a comctl32 property sheet;
  needs the real comctl32/oleaut32 in `test/binaries/dlls`). *Play MDK2*
  writes `save\config.lua` and spawns `mdk2main.exe`. Without that file
  mdk2Main.exe stops with "ERROR: Missing file. Please make sure the game is
  being run from the install directory." (it loads `config`, then
  `defaultconfig`, as Lua from `save\ scripts\ override\ override\english\
  data\` and the zips; `0x41fbc0`, error helper `0x4522e0`).
- The launcher's defaults (Default OpenGL Driver, 640x480x16, bilinear,
  mipmap, full screen) write exactly these 88 bytes, captured from a CLI run:
  `chSetVideoMode(640, 480, 16, 16, 60, 1, 1, 0.8, 0, 1, 0, 0)\r\n`
  `chSndForceSoftwareMode(1)\r\n` (note `1`, not `0`).
- Through the launcher the spawned child sits in the same wait as below; run
  mdk2Main.exe directly with that config installed (as shogo_demo does).

## OpenGL init (what was fixed)

`0x4526e0` suspends the worker thread (`SuspendThread([0x4b8810])`, the
`_beginthread(0x451f30)` file-request worker), sets the video mode and
resumes it at `0x4534a3`. If GL init fails, the error path loads strings
through that **suspended** worker and both threads idle in `SleepEx` forever
(main polls `[0x4b87d0]` at `0x4522b0`/`0x4522d0`) — no window, no message.
GL init failed for two reasons, both fixed:

1. `ReBaseImage` (imagehlp) had no api_table row: it rebases the GL driver
   file below 0x64500000 before LoadLibrary and ignores the result. A missing
   image is now FALSE/ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND (`test-rebaseimage.js`).
2. Its GL loader resolves every name with GetProcAddress and gives up on a
   NULL: `wglDescribeLayerPlane`, `wgl{Get,Set}LayerPaletteEntries`,
   `wglRealizeLayerPalette` (now answered from the pixel format: no layer
   planes) and `wglUseFont{Bitmaps,Outlines}A` (fail-fast rows)
   (`test-wgl-layer-planes.js`).

It then creates its context (ChangeDisplaySettingsA, wglCreateContext,
wglMakeCurrent) and draws. `glVertex4f`/`glVertex4fv` with w = 1.0 are now
exactly glVertex3f/3fv (11,890 calls in one run).

## Blocker

A `glVertex4fv` from call site `0x464ffb` passes w ≠ 1 (projective). The
packed vertex carries no w, and dividing through is wrong for
perspective-correct interpolation and impossible for w = 0, so the handler
fails fast there. Needs w in the GL encoder's vertex format (WAT encoder +
JS/Worker backends).
