# MDK2 demo (BioWare/Interplay, 2000)

**Status: registered (`mdk2_demo`), playable in the browser.** Projective
vertices work since 9be0a0efb. Menu, New Game, the intro and the tutorial
level all render and take input (Chromium, real WebGL). The "attract demo
ignores input" puzzle was only the menu's idle timer (see Route). The fetch
needs a real `unshield` (IS6 cabs; `tools/is5-extract.js` refuses them).

## Source

archive.org `Mdk2Demo`: `MDK2Demo.exe`, 86,442,069 bytes, SHA-1
`981cd1f0774c6dae690cdf97bf08d975a43f8e81`. No licence or redistribution
grant (readmeEN.txt names BioWare Corp. and Interplay registration only), so
local-only.

It is an InstallShield 6 self-extractor: 7z unpacks `data1.cab`/`data2.cab`;
**unshield** reads them (`tools/is5-extract.js` refuses: cab version
0x100600c). The game is file group `Minimum` (MDK2.exe launcher,
mdk2Main.exe, `data\base.zip`/`scripts.zip`/`sounds.zip`, Music\*.acm) plus
group `english` (`data\local.zip`, the string tables). Installed to
`c:\mdk2demo`.

## Startup

- **`MDK2.exe` is only the hardware launcher** (a comctl32 property sheet;
  needs the real comctl32/oleaut32 in `test/binaries/dlls`). *Play MDK2*
  writes `save\config.lua` and spawns `mdk2main.exe`. Without that file
  mdk2Main.exe stops with "ERROR: Missing file. Please make sure the game is
  being run from the install directory." (it loads `config`, then
  `defaultconfig`, as Lua from `save\ scripts\ override\ override\english\
  data\` and the zips; `0x41fbc0`, error helper `0x4522e0`).
- The launcher's defaults (Default OpenGL Driver, 640x480x16, bilinear,
  mipmap, full screen) write exactly these 88 bytes, captured from a CLI run:
  `chSetVideoMode(640, 480, 16, 16, 60, 1, 1, 0.8, 0, 1, 0, 0)\r\n`
  `chSndForceSoftwareMode(1)\r\n` (note `1`, not `0`).
- Through the launcher the spawned child sits in the same wait as below; run
  mdk2Main.exe directly with that config installed (as shogo_demo does).

## Open

- **Jump binding unknown**: right mouse and Ctrl probes landed on the Pause
  menu (Esc-timing drift), so the touch layout has no Jump button. Read it
  from Paused → Options → controls and add it.
- **World drops to black mid-play** (HUD and prompts still drawn): seen in
  WebKit software GL just before a Jump probe, at level start in the CLI,
  and when the intro cutscene ran to its end. Unknown whether game-side
  (fade/visibility) or ours.

- Playwright WebKit on Linux has no WebGL on a Worker's OffscreenCanvas
  (control: `getContext` returns null there, a main-thread canvas works), so
  the GL render worker cannot create a context and the game area stays gray.
  Real iOS Safari 17+ has worker WebGL; the WebKit touch pass used
  `?gl-renderer=software`.
